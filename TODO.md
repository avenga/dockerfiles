* schedule regular rebuilds
// document local development
// long Git hash in docker-build/run.sh (anywhere else?)
// all tests do not use "latest", since it might be from upstream and not from
  the just build images
// switch to opencontainer labels
// !!!! make `--pull` the default in `docker-build/run.sh`
* gitlab-job might use avenga/docker as base
* some tests build the images by themselves
